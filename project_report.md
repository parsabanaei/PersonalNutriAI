## Problem Statement

### What is the problem that you are trying to solve?

The current healthcare landscape faces a critical gap in accessible, comprehensive health risk assessment. While individual health conditions like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease affect millions of Americans (36%, 11%, and 20% respectively), existing assessment tools are fragmented and inadequate:

**Current Limitations:**
- **Fragmented Approach:** Separate tools for different conditions, preventing holistic health evaluation
- **Limited Accessibility:** Professional health assessments are expensive and require clinical visits
- **Oversimplified Solutions:** Basic BMI calculators and generic risk scores lack personalization
- **Lack of Integration:** No unified system combining multiple health risks with actionable insights

**The Gap:** There is no accessible, integrated machine learning system that can assess multiple health risks simultaneously using readily available personal information while providing clinically valid, explainable predictions.

**Project Goal:** Develop a comprehensive ML-powered health risk assessment system that democratizes personalized health evaluation by combining obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease risk prediction in a single, accessible platform.
